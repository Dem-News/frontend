# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the suggested testing strategy for this React Native application. Consistent and thorough testing is crucial for maintaining code quality, preventing regressions, and ensuring a reliable user experience.

## Recommended Tools

*   **Jest:** A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It's well-suited for unit and integration testing in React Native projects.
*   **React Native Testing Library:** Builds on top of DOM Testing Library by providing utilities to test React Native components in a way that resembles how users interact with them.

## What to Test

### 1. Unit Tests
*   **Purpose:** To test individual functions, modules, or classes in isolation.
*   **Targets:**
    *   Helper functions (e.g., utility functions for data transformation).
    *   Redux reducers: Verify that reducers return the expected state for given actions.
    *   Redux action creators (if they contain logic).
    *   Business logic within services or non-UI components.
*   **Example:** Given a specific state and an action, a reducer should produce a predictable new state.

### 2. Component Tests
*   **Purpose:** To test individual React components, ensuring they render correctly and respond to user interactions as expected.
*   **Targets:**
    *   Screen components.
    *   Reusable UI components (e.g., `NewsCard`, custom buttons).
*   **Example:** A `NewsCard` component should render all the provided news details. Tapping on a "verify" button within the card should trigger the correct callback function.
*   **Tools:** Use React Native Testing Library for querying the component tree and simulating events.

### 3. Integration Tests
*   **Purpose:** To test the interaction between different parts of the application.
*   **Targets:**
    *   Navigation flow between screens.
    *   Interaction between components and Redux state (e.g., dispatching an action and verifying state change and UI update).
    *   Components that fetch data from services.
*   **Example:** After a user logs in (mocked API call), they should be navigated to the HomeScreen, and their profile information should be displayed.

### 4. Service/API Tests
*   **Purpose:** To test the logic within API service files (`src/services/api.js`).
*   **Targets:**
    *   Functions that make API calls.
    *   Request/response interceptors.
*   **Method:** Use Jest's mocking capabilities (`jest.mock`) to mock `axios` or other HTTP clients. This allows testing how your service handles successful responses, errors, and data transformation without making actual network requests.
*   **Example:** When `newsAPI.getNewsByLocation` is called, ensure it constructs the correct request URL and parameters. Test how it handles a successful response versus an error response from the mocked API.

## Test File Location

*   Test files should typically be placed in a `__tests__` directory within the component's or module's folder, or alongside the file they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.js` and `MyComponent.test.js`).
*   Example: `src/components/__tests__/NewsCard.test.js` or `src/components/NewsCard.test.js`.

## Running Tests

*   Add a test script to `package.json`, e.g., `"test": "jest"`.
*   Run tests using `npm test` or `yarn test`.

This strategy provides a foundation for building a robust and maintainable application. It's recommended to write tests as you develop new features or fix bugs.
